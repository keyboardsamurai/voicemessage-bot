00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,850
this it said that there are 43 words in
the full response to this prompt

484
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:58,860
the full response to this prompt
 

485
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,190
the full response to this prompt
including the word in the question and

486
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
including the word in the question and
 

487
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,870
including the word in the question and
the answer okay that's kind of weird I

488
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
the answer okay that's kind of weird I
 

489
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,829
the answer okay that's kind of weird I
didn't want to include the question

490
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
didn't want to include the question
 

491
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,810
didn't want to include the question
itself but let's see if it got it right

492
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:05,820
itself but let's see if it got it right
 

493
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,970

I said list them out and count them and

494
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:07,980
I said list them out and count them and
 

495
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,590

then it went through including the

then it went through including the
 

497
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,870
then it went through including the

prompt which I didn't want but fine how
 

499
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,449

many words are in the full response etc

503
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,750

505
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,090
